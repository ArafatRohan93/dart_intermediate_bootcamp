# Dart Intermediate Bootcamp

Welcome to the Dart Intermediate Bootcamp! This repository is designed to enhance your understanding of Dart's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through practical examples.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* **OOP/**: Contains five Dart files, each demonstrating a specific OOP concept.

## üìö OOP Section

Explore the OOP concepts through the following files:

1. [**Inheritance**](https://github.com/ArafatRohan93/dart_intermediate_bootcamp/blob/main/OOP/inheritance.md): Demonstrates how classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes.

2. [**Polymorphism**](https://github.com/ArafatRohan93/dart_intermediate_bootcamp/blob/main/OOP/polymorphism.md): Shows how methods can behave differently based on the object that is invoking them.

3. [**Encapsulation**](https://github.com/ArafatRohan93/dart_intermediate_bootcamp/blob/main/OOP/encapsulation.md): Illustrates how to restrict access to certain components of an object.

4. [**Abstraction**](https://github.com/ArafatRohan93/dart_intermediate_bootcamp/blob/main/OOP/abstraction.md): Explains how to hide complex implementation details and show only the necessary features of an object.

5. [**Composition vs Inheritance**](https://github.com/ArafatRohan93/dart_intermediate_bootcamp/blob/main/OOP/inheritance_vs_composition.md): Covers how to define contracts that classes can implement.
